## Footswitches and LEDs
![Light Pipe and SMD LED](./img/Light_Pipe_SMD_LED.png)

The top panel footswitch and LED control is connected via ribbon cable to the front panel control pcb.

### Front panel LEDs (Ref: Neural DSP teardown video)
The front panel LEDs are actually **SMD RGB-LEDs**. The light is then transmitted to the panel via so called *light pipes*.

The light pipes Neural DSP uses are colorless but diffused. Important for surface mount light pipes are *crushing ribs*, since they're self-locking.

#### Example parts on Mouser Electronics
* [LEDs](https://www.mouser.de/c/optoelectronics/led-lighting/led-emitters/standard-leds-smd/?illumination%20color=RGB&product=RGB%20LEDs)
* [Light pipes](https://www.mouser.de/c/optoelectronics/led-indication/led-light-pipes/?color=Water%2C%20Clear&number%20of%20elements=1%20Element&orientation=Vertical&product=Rigid%20Light%20Pipes)

### SPST-Rotary encoder mechanism (Ref: Neural DSP teardown video)

// TODO

### Microcontroller (Ref: Neural DSP teardown video)
The PCB uses a dedicated microcontroller (part indiscernible) to manage the LEDs and footswitches. It would probably be something like an *STM32F4* type of microcontroller due to high performance requirements of real-time switching. It might also use an external chrystal due to communication via USB or UART.

## Wifi Chip (Ref: Neural DSP teardown video)
The QC uses a [Microchip Technology: ATWILC3000-MR110CA](https://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/Microchip-Technology/ATWILC3000-MR110CA?qs=9KdFJXLqUo%252BfAV4khUOwHQ%3D%3D) Wifi-Chip. It is positioned at the left hand side of the enclosure, next to the enclosures cooling slots. This is probably due to the enclosure shielding RF-frequencies and thus having a chance to pick up the signals via the slots.
